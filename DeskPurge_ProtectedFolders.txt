# DeskPurge Protected Folders Configuration
# 
# Add your game library root folders here (one path per line).
# These act as "stop boundaries" when the script walks up parent folders.
#
# The script ALREADY protects (no need to add these):
#   - Root drives (C:\, D:\, E:\, etc.)
#   - C:\Windows, C:\Program Files, C:\Program Files (x86)
#   - Your User Profile, Desktop, and Public Desktop
#
# You only need to list YOUR GAME LIBRARY FOLDERS below:

# Common examples (uncomment/modify as needed):
# E:\Games
# D:\SteamLibrary
# E:\SteamLibrary
# C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common
# D:\EpicGames
# D:\GOG Games
# D:\Origin Games
# C:\XboxGames
# D:\Games
# D:\~Games~
# C:\Games
