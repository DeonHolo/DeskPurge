# DeskPurge Protected Folders Configuration
# 
# Add your game library root folders here (one path per line).
# These act as "stop boundaries" when the script walks up parent folders.

# The script ALREADY protects (no need to add these):
#   - Root drives (C:\, D:\, E:\, etc.)
#   - C:\Windows, C:\Program Files, C:\Program Files (x86)
#   - Your User Profile, Desktop, and Public Desktop
